## Exploring Land Cover and Use in Colombia in 2019
For the following exercises, we first introduce a new dataset: a dataset about the land cover of Colombia from EU's Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) https://land.copernicus.eu/en/products/global-dynamic-land-cover. 

The Dynamic Land Cover data set cover annual global land cover maps and cover fraction layers, providing a deyailed view of land cover at three classification levels and achieving 80% accuracy at class level 1 on each continent.
